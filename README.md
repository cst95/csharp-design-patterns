# Design Patterns
## Creational
### Builder
Useful for object creation when there are many possible configurations for the object, or when the instatantion is complex resulting in a constructor with many parameters.
* **Fluent builder** - allows us to chain calls to the builder.
* **Inheritable fluent builder** - allows us to extend the behaviour of a builder class, but requires the use of recursive generics in order to make it fluent.
* **Functional builder**
